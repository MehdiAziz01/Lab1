My favorite anime is **Naruto** because it teaches so many valuable life lessons, like **Never Giving Up**.
Some sayings from the array of things that i've watched which still resonate with me are:
> Set Your Heart Ablaze.

> The Rich get richer.

> Obsession defeats genius even when genius works hard.

# Background
I was born in Afghanistan and moved to the United States when I was a one year old. I have been in the bay area my entire life but made a change three years ago, when I moved to San Diego for college.
I am currently in my last quarter at UCSD and I am extremeley enthusiastic for the next steps of my life. I am eager to see the endless opportunities which await.
